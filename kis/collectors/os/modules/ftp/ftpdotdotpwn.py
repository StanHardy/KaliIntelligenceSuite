"""
run tool dotdotpwn on each identified in-scope FTP service where access credentials are known to KIS. alternatively, use
optional arguments -u and -p to specify a user name and password. note, this collector only works in combination with
argument -S as dotdotpwn requires user interaction. argument -S prints the commands and then you have to execute them
manually
