# kiscollect

This script implements a commandline interface to collect intelligence. The collection is performed by so called
collectors.

A collector is a Python module, which can operate on the IP address (e.g., collector shodanhost), IP network
(e.g., collector tcpnmap), service (e.g., collector ftphydra), or second-level domain (e.g., collector theharvester)
level. The collectors create these commands based on the data that is available in the KIS database and after each
execution, they perform the following tasks:

  * Analyse the OS command's output
  * Report any potential valuable information to the user
  * Enrich the data (e.g., newly identified IPv4 addresses, host names, URLs, credentials, etc.) in the database to
  ensure that subsequent collectors can re-use it

Collectors are executed in a specific order to ensure that information required by one collector (e.g., httpeyewitness)
is already collected by another (e.g., httpgobuster).

Note: service-level collectors identify services from which they can collect intelligence by comparing the protocol
(TCP or UDP) and port number or by the nmap service name. the nmap service name is useful, if services are running on
non-standard ports. at the moment, only the service names of nmap are supported, which means that only from
nmap scan results, KIS is able to collect intel from services running on non-standard ports.

The script provides the following functionalities and some case studies are provided at the end of kiscollect's help.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

collectors:
  use the following arguments to collect intelligence

  --anyservicenmap      run tool nmap on any open in-scope service to obtain
                        additional intelligence. this collector useful after
                        importing masscan scan results or after executing
                        collector tcpmasscannetwork. with this collector, nmap
                        obtains the service name (e.g, ssh or http) from non-
                        standard ports, which allows subsequently executed
                        collectors to determine whether they apply
  --awsslurp            run tool slurp on each in-scope second-level domain

                        in-scope second-level domain or network to obtain
                        additional host names via the crt.sh web site.
                        depending on the number of certificates the company
                        has registered. note that this command might take a
                        long time to complete as between each certificate
                        request, the command sleeps between 2 and 5 seconds

  --dnsspf              run tool dig on each in-scope second-level domain
                        (e.g., megacorpone.com) using the operating system's
                        DNS server to obtain SPF information. use optional
                        argument --dns-server to explicitly specify another
                        DNS server

                        (e.g., megacorpone.com) using the operating system's
                        DNS server to obtain DNS resource records NS and
                        CNAME. use optional argument --dns-server to
                        explicitly specify another DNS server
  --dnszonetransfer     run tool dig on each in-scope second-level domain
                        (e.g., megacorpone.com) using the operating system's
                        DNS server to test for DNS zone transfers.
  --enum4linux          run tool enum4linux on each identified in-scope SMB
                        service

                        service (TCP)
  --ftpdotdotpwn        run tool dotdotpwn on each identified in-scope FTP
                        service where access credentials are known to KIS.
                        alternatively, use optional arguments -u and -p to
                        specify a user name and password. note, this collector
                        only works in combination with argument -S as
                        dotdotpwn requires user interaction. argument -S
                        prints the commands and then you have to execute them
                        manually
  --ftpfilelist         run tool curl on each identified in-scope FTP service
                        where access credentials are known to KIS (use
                        ftphydra to brute- force credentials). alternatively,
                        use optional arguments -u and -p to specify a user
                        name and password
  --ftphydra            run tool hydra on each identified in-scope FTP service
                        to brute-force user accounts. per default, the brute-
                        force is performed using a default word list (use
                        argument -S to figure out which one). alternatively,
                        use optional arguments -p and -u; -P and -U; or -C to
                        specify other access credentials
  --ftpnmap             run tool nmap with all safe NSE scripts on all
                        identified in-scope FTP services

                        haveibeenpwned.com) in which the email address
                        appears. depending on the number of email addresses in
                        the current workspace, it might be desired to limit
                        the number of OS commands by using the optional
                        argument --filter
  --haveibeenpaste      run tool kismanage on each identified in-scope email
                        address to determine pastes (using haveibeenpwned.com)
                        in which the email address appears. depending on the
                        number of email addresses in the current workspace, it
                        might be desired to limit the number of OS commands by
                        using the optional argument --filter
  --hostio              run tool kismanage on each identified in-scope second-
                        level domain to identify relationships to other
                        second-level domains via host.io. depending on the
                        number of domains in the current workspace, it might
                        be desired to limit the number of OS commands by using

                        as these scans are aggressive and therefore, might
                        cause damage. therefore, it might be desired to limit

                        identified in-scope SMTP services
  --smtpuserenum        run tool smtpuserenum on each identified in-scope SMTP
                        service to brute-force valid user names. use the
                        mandatory argument -L to specify a file containing
                        user names to enumerate
  --snmpcheck           run tool snmpcheck on each identified in-scope SNMP

  --snmphydra           run tool hydra on each identified in-scope SNMP
                        service to brute-force user accounts. per default, the
                        brute-force is performed using a default word list
                        (use argument -S to figure out which one).
                        alternatively, use optional arguments -p and -u; -P

                        service. note, this collector only works in
                        combination with argument -S as dotdotpwn requires
                        user interaction. argument -S prints the commands and
                        then you have to execute them manually

  --vhostgobuster       run tool gobuster on each identified in-scope HTTP(S)
                        service to enumerate existing URIs. if credentials for
                        basic authentication are known to KIS, then they will
                        be automatically used. alternatively, use optional
                        arguments -u and -p to provide a user name and
                        password for basic authentication. use optional
                        argument --cookies to specify a list of cookies,
                        optional argument --user-agent to specify a different

  --virustotal          run tool kismanage on each identified in-scope second-
                        level domain to obtain domain information via
                        virustotal.com. depending on the number of domains in
                        the current workspace, it might be desired to limit
                        the number of OS commands by using the optional
                        argument --filter
  --vncnmap             run tool nmap with all safe NSE scripts on all
                        identified in-scope VNC services
  --vncviewer           connect to VNC services via vncviewer application
                        (only one thread is allowed). use option -P to provide
                        a list of password files
  --whoisdomain         run tool whois on all identified in- and out-of-scope
                        second-level domains. depending on the number of

                        limit the number of OS commands by using the optional
                        argument --filter. note that in order to reduce the
                        number of whois requests, KIS only queries one
                        IPv4/IPv6 address per network range returned by whois
                        and all remaining queries are ignored
  --whoisnetwork        run tool whois on all identified in- and out-of-scope

                        identified in-scope X11 services

general options:
  use the following arguments to specify how intelligence is collected

  --continue            indefinitely repeat the execution of selected
                        collectors
  --cookies N [N ...]   list of cookies that shall be used by collectors (e.g.
                        "Cookie: JSESSION=123")
  --debug               prints extra information to log file
  --dns-server SERVER   DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8) that shall be used by
                        collectors to query DNS information. otherwise, the
                        system's DNS server is used
  --filter IP|NETWORK|HOST [IP|NETWORK|HOST ...]
                        list of IPv4/IPv6 networks/addresses or domain/host
                        names that shall be processed.per default, mentioned
                        items are excluded. add + in front of item (e.g.,
                        +127.0.0.1) to process only these items
  --hashes              if specified, then the passwords specified via
                        arguments -p or -P are interpreted as hashes (this
                        adds arguments -m 'LocalHash' to hydra and -m
                        PASS:HASH to medusa)
  --http-proxy HTTP_PROXY
                        specify an HTTP(S) proxy that shall be used by
                        collectors in the format https://$ip:$port
  --proxychains         perform all collections via proxychains
  --restart {failed,terminated,completed} [{failed,terminated,completed} ...]
                        per default, kiscollect continues the collection from
                        the last interruption point, and ignores all
                        previously failed or terminated commands. With this
                        option the collection of commands with statuses
                        failed, terminated, or completed can be restarted.
  --strict              collect information only from services that are
                        definitely open (nmap state is open). ports with nmap
                        status 'open|filtered' are ignored. this option
                        decreases the intel collection time but might not be
                        as comprehensive
  --user-agent AGENT    set a user agent string
  --vhost {all,domain}  per default all HTTP(S) collectors (e.g., httpnikto,
                        httpgobuster) use the IPv4/IPv6 address to scan the
                        target web application. virtual hosts, which are not
                        accessible via this IPv4/IPv6 address are not scanned.
                        if this argument is specified, then the HTTP(S)
                        service intelligence gathering is performed on all
                        known in-scope host names. use choice 'domain' if you
                        want to collect intel just on the host names or use
                        choice 'all' to collect intel based on both -
                        IPv4/IPv6 addresses and host names
  -A, --analyze         re-analyze the already collected information. use this
                        option if you updated the verify_results method of a
                        collector and you want to import the update into the
                        database
  -B, --batch-mode      automatically start, execute, and stop the application
                        without user interaction
  -C COMBO_FILE, --combo-file COMBO_FILE
                        user name password combo files that shall be used by
                        collectors. the internal structure of the combo file
                        varies depending on the used collectors. for example,
                        hydra collectors have a different structure than
                        medusa collectors
  -D MIN, --delay-min MIN
                        minimum number of seconds between each operating
                        system command executions. if specified together with
                        option -M, then KIS randomly computes a delay between
                        MIN and MAX per execution else, the delay is always
                        MIN
  -L WORDLIST_FILES [WORDLIST_FILES ...], --wordlist-files WORDLIST_FILES [WORDLIST_FILES ...]
                        list of files containing words (e.g., host names or
                        URLs) that shall be used by collectors. usually KIS
                        creates one command per specified word list
  -M MAX, --delay-max MAX
                        maximum number of seconds between each operating
                        system command executions. if specified together with
                        option -D, then KIS randomly computes a delay between
                        MIN and MAX per execution else, the delay is always
                        MAX
  -P PASSWORD_FILE, --password-file PASSWORD_FILE
                        file containing passwords that shall be used by
                        collectors
  -S, --print-commands  print commands to be executed in console instead of
                        executing them. use this option to see how tools
                        (e.g., dnsenum) are executed
  -U USER_FILE, --user-file USER_FILE
                        file containing user names that shall be used by
                        collectors
  -d DOMAIN, --domain DOMAIN
                        domain or workgroup that shall be used by collectors
  -l, --list            list existing workspaces
  -o OUTPUT_DIR         KIS uses a temporary working directory to store all
                        temporary files. this working directory is deleted
                        when KIS quits. use this argument to specify an
                        alternative working directory, which must be manually
                        deleted. this argument is usually useful during
                        debugging
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        password that shall be used by collectors
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        number of threads that execute collection
  -u USER, --user USER  username that shall be used by collectors
  -w WORKSPACE, --workspace WORKSPACE
                        the workspace within the collection is executed

---- USE CASES ----

- I. http directory brute-force and screenshoting

identify subdomains for a given second-level domain using gobuster, crts.sh, and sublist3r; scan the identified host 
names for web services (TCP ports 80, 443, 8080, and 8443) using nmap; do a directory brute force on each identified 
web service using gobuster; and create screenshots for each identified URL using eyewitness

before starting, specify a workspace $ws (e.g., ws=test) as well as a domain/host name (e.g., 
domains=megacorpone.com or domains=www.megacorpone.com). in addition, all IPv4/IPv6 addresses to which host 
names resolve (0.0.0.0/0) are in scope

import networks into database and execute collection
$ kismanage workspace --add $ws
$ kismanage domain -w $ws --add $domain
$ kismanage network -w $ws --add 0.0.0.0/0     # Any IPv4 address is in scope
$ kiscollect -w $ws -t4 --debug --vhost domain --dnshost --dnssublist3r --crtshdomain --dnsgobuster \ 
    --tcpnmapdomain 80 443 8080 8443 --httpnmap --httpmsfrobotstxt --httpgobuster
    
collect screenshots with aquatone
$ kisreport path -w apbank --scope within --type Http --csv | csvcut -H -c 15 | aquatone -out aquatone

obtain CSV list of identified IPv4/IPv6 addresses and services
$ kisreport host -w $ws --csv

obtain list of identified paths
$ kisreport path -w $ws --csv

obtain report about all executed httpgobuster commands (option -I)
$ kisreport host -w $ws --text -I httpgobuster

- II. semi-passive subdomain gathering

conservatively collect information (e.g., subdomains, email addresses, IPv4/IPv6 addresses, or IPv4/IPv6 address 
ownerships) about second-level domains using whois, theharvester, and sublist3r as well as via the APIs provided by 
censys.io, dnsdumpster.com, builtwith.com, host.io, and securitytrails.com. in addition, obtain whois information 
for each host name and IPv4/IPv6 address

before you  start: specify a workspace $ws (e.g., ws=osint) and the list of public domains $domains to 
investigate (e.g., domains=megacorpone.com or domains=www.megacorpone.com)

import domains into database and execute collection

- III. passive information gathering using censys.io and shodan.io

passively collect information (e.g., subdomains from certificates or service information) about IPv4/IPv6 networks/
addresses using the APIs provided by censys.io and shodan.io

before the start: specify a workspace $ws (e.g., ws=osint) and the list of public 
IPv4/IPv6 networks/addresses $networks to investigate

import IPv4/IPv6 networks/addresses into database and execute collection

$ kismanage workspace --add $ws
$ kismanage network -w $ws --add $networks
$ kiscollect -w $ws --debug --censyshost --shodannetwork

export collected information into microsoft excel
$ kisreport excel /tmp/kis-scan-results.xlsx -w $ws

review scan results of all hosts
$ kisreport host -w $ws --text | less -R

- IV. active intel gathering during penetration test

check services (e.g., FTP, SNMP, MSSQL, etc.) for default credentials using hydra; check access to file sharing 
services (e.g., NFS and SMB) using smbclient, enum4linux, or showmount; check web applications using gobuster, nikto, 
davtest, and eyewitness; obtain TLS information using sslscan, sslyze, and nmap. the collection is performed on 
previously executed nmap scans and a list of in-scope IPv4/IPv6 networks/addresses

before you  start: specify a workspace $ws (e.g., ws=pentest), the paths to the nmap XML files 
(e.g., nmap_paths=/tmp/scan1/*.xml /tmp/scan2/*.xml or nmap_paths=/tmp/scan1/nmap-tcp-all.xml 
/tmp/scan1/nmap-udp-top100.xml) as well as a list of in-scope $networks (e.g., networks=192.168.0.0/24, 
networks=192.168.1.0/24 192.168.1.0/24, networks=192.168.0.1, or networks=192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2)

import nmap scan results as well as in-scope IPv4/IPv6 networks/addresses into database and execute collection
$ kismanage workspace --add $ws
$ kismanage network -w $ws --add $networks
$ kismanage scan -w $ws --nmap $nmap_paths

$ kisreport excel /tmp/kis-scan-results.xlsx -w $ws

export screenshots to $workdir for manual review
$ kisreport file -w $ws --file screenshot -O $workdir

review scan results of hosts with IPv4/IPv6 addresses $ip1 and $ip2
$ kisreport host -w $ws --text --filter +$ip1 +$ip2

review scan results of all hosts except hosts with IPv4/IPv6 addresses $ip1 and $ip2
$ kisreport host -w $ws --text --filter $ip1 $ip2

review scan results of collectors httpnikto and httpgobuster
$ kisreport host -w $ws --text -I httpnikto httpgobuster

If kiscollect is started, then the user is presented with a user interface like the following:

![User interface after starting kiscollect](images/kiscollector_01.png "User interface after starting kiscollect")

The user interface is divided into the following three sections:

  1. **Collector list**: Provides you an overview of the collection status per collector. The numbers tell you how
  many Kali commands are pending, failed, or succeeded. The order of the collectors in this list is also the order of
  execution.
  2. **Thread info**: Shows you which thread runs which collector on which host, service, or domain for how long. Note
  that only the Kali commands of one collector are executed at a time and all Kali commands of the collector must be
  finished before continuing the execution of Kali commands of the next collector. Why? Subsequent collectors might depend
  on the information identified by the current collector. In addition, you might see several threads working on the same
  service. That's intended as one collector can create several commands, which are then executed by different threads in
  parallel.
  3. **Report items**: If a collector finds interesting information (e.g., credentials), then this information is shown
  in this area. This allows the immediate analysis of the identified information. In addition, this information is 
  also logged in log file `/opt/kaliintelsuite/kis/kaliintelsuite.log`. Note that this section is not scrollable. If 
  you want to access the data, then open the log file `/opt/kaliintelsuite/kis/kaliintelsuite.log`, which is located 
  in the output directory.

You can interact with `kiscollect` using the following commands. Each command is executed after you hit the enter key.

  * **s** starts the collection
  * **k** followed by the thread ID shown in the **Thread info** section, will kill the thread. `k1` will for example
  kill the first thread in the **Thread info** section.
  * **t** followed by the thread ID shown in the **Thread info** section, will terminate the thread. `t5` will for
  example terminate the fifth thread in the **Thread info** section.
  * **n** terminates all commands of the current collector and continues with the commands of the next collector.
  * **q** terminates all commands and quits the application.

If you add argument `-S` (show) to any `kiscollect` command, then KIS just prints the created OS commands. This helps in
  * gaining a better understanding of what the commands are actually doing or
  * in executing a single command manually for testing purposes.

Per default, when KIS is restarted, it does not execute OS commands that have successfully completed again. If you want
to force re-execution, then you have to add argument `-I` (ignore status).

**Note 1**: Make sure that the terminal where you start this command is in full screen mode and do not resize it.

**Note 2**: Do not start more than one process of `kiscollect` in parallel as `kiscollect` performs a cleanup during
the startup phase. Thereby, it deletes all commands whose execution have not been started. Consequently, the
kiscollect process that was started first, won't be able to find its commands anymore. As a result, you will find a
lot of exceptions in the `/opt/kaliintelsuite/kis/kaliintelsuite.log` file.
